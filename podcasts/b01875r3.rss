<item><title>Gospel and social change: Gillian Burke and Karen Gibson</title><description>In 2014 the biologist and presenter Gillian Burke joined a community choir in Falmouth in a bid to strengthen her voice. Singing is Gillian's passion and it's her way of switching off from work and the pressures of life.

In this third programme Gillian speaks to the conductor of The Kingdom Choir, Karen Gibson.  Karen grew up singing in church and Gospel groups, before graduating to the role of choir conductor on a BBC radio programme called The Gospel Train.  She was asked to perform on the 35th anniversary of 'Songs of Praise', and The Kingdom Choir was born.  In 2018 they stepped onto the global stage when they were invited to perform at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.  

Gillian asks Karen about her route into Gospel music.  They discuss Gospel as a vehicle for hope, and whether there's any tension between performing faith-based music on a commercial stage.  And what, if anything, the environmental movement might learn from Gospel music's part in the American Civil Rights Movement.

<item><title>Gospel music in Cornwall: Gillian Burke and Ley Adewole</title><description>In 2014 the biologist and presenter Gillian Burke joined a community choir in Falmouth in a bid to strengthen her voice.  Singing is Gillian's passion and it's her way of switching off from work and the pressures of life.  Ley Adewole is the Director of the Falmouth Community Gospel Choir.  Ley began singing in a Pentecostal church in Coventry; she joined various singing groups, got spotted and went on to do session work.  She relocated to Falmouth and set-up a gospel music workshop to fill-in the winter months.  The choir was born, welcoming in people of all faiths, and even those who can and can't sing.  

Gillian quizzes Ley on singing with conviction and how the science of singing melds with the emotions of the music.  They talk about the gospel music scene in Cornwall and how the Cornish accent influences how the choir sounds.  They speak about an early choir performance when Ley was standing on fishing crates in her heels so she could be seen by the choir, and how the music transformed a sceptical audience into one full of men crying into their beer.

She loves sudden startles and that sense of creeping enjoyable fear in person, in books and on screen, but she wants to know why. Why are some humans wired to get a thrill out of fear? Why not all of us?

Felicity talks to fear expert Dr Margee Kerr, sociologist and author of Scream: Chilling Adventures in the Science of Fear, about what happens in our bodies when we’re frightened, and how, surprisingly, this can help us build relationships and personal resilience. She asks: what’s the difference between the feelings we experience in a haunted house and genuine terror? Why do children love being chased? Is fear really contagious?

<item><title>Learning A Skill: Kieran Yates speaks to Yewande Adesida</title><description>Like much of the country, the last year has seen people picking up new skills to pass the time, from cooking, yoga or becoming knitting experts. But what about the small things that many people have learned before adulthood? In this set of programmes, journalist Kieran Yates explores how adopting seemingly simple skills in later life - that maybe we missed out on learning when we were younger, or that we have to face now - can lead to radical changes in our well-being. 

In this programme she speaks to Yewande Adesida, a cyclist who, in her twenties, decided to switch from her career as a competitive rower to a racing track cyclist. Kieran meets Yewande at Herne Hill velodrome and asks her just how much getting on a bike as an adult opened up the world for her, and as somebody who can't ride a bike herself, sees if Yewande can help get her pedalling.

<item><title>Tech for Good: Marcus Smith speaks to Kriti Sharma</title><description>What do you think of when you hear the words "A.I." or "Artificial Intelligence"?  Thanks to science-fiction it's often strange-looking humanoids or futuristic robots hell-bent on destruction.  But as Kriti Sharma points out, we are probably using A.I. hundreds of times a day without even thinking about it.  It could be, she says, a bank deciding whether to accept or reject your application, or an algorithm might decide whether you get a job interview or what exam grade you receieve.  She made her first robot when she was a teenager, and has gone on to use A.I. to help the victims of domestic abuse and to challenge the rise of what she sees as subservient female online assistants.   Kriti is now an advisor on A.I. to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. 

Marcus Smith is a content creator from Bristol and a digital native. He is fascinated by technology's impact on us and has studied the effects of online gambling on young people. For 'One to One', Marcus is looking at the 'tech for good' movement and speaks to two leading figures in the tech industry - one who argues that it is currently a force for bad, and one who tries to work with tech to harness the good.

For this second programme, Marcus asks Kriti why she thinks A.I. often has in-built gender and race biases, and hears how she is tackling this by inviting more people from varied backgrounds into the design process.

<item><title>OCD: Tuppence Middleton talks to David Adam</title><description>Actress Tuppence Middleton has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It's not something she's really talked about before, except with a therapist. That is, until now. In this series, she's on a mission to find out more about the disorder - and herself - and to bust some myths along the way.

Today, she talks journalist David Adam, writer of the best-selling book 'The Man Who Couldn't Stop' with the strap-line 'OCD and the true story of a life lost in thought.' David's OCD was triggered by an illogical obsession with contracting HIV/AIDS in the 1980s. He says each era has its "bogeyman". What might this mean for people today, in the age of coronavirus?

Well yes, according to Tristan Harris, one of the contributors to the successful Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma.

<item><title>My Donation Story: Sabet Choudhury talks to Saj Khan</title><description>BBC journalist Sabet Choudhury donated a kidney to his mother five years ago.  He says it was not a difficult decision to make. Once he heard she only had 3 years to live unless he stepped up, his decision was already made. The transplant transformed her life and Sabet says it opened his eyes to the whole issue of organ donation. During his personal donation journey he discovered that there is a lack of organ donors from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities in the UK and this can lead to extra-long waits for a transplant. In this, the last of three programmes, Sabet talks to Saj Khan, a teacher from Birmingham who has experience of the emotional highs and lows of waiting for a kidney. Saj had his first transplant as a very young man, but sadly the kidney failed just after he graduated and he has spent years and years waiting for a new kidney.

<item><title>My Donation Story: Sabet Choudhury meets Faruk Choudhury</title><description>Five years ago BBC journalist Sabet Choudhury donated a kidney to his mother. She’d been given just three years to live and the transplant transformed her life. Sabet, who is of Bangladeshi origin, says it wasn’t a difficult decision to make once he realised she could be waiting for years, because of a shortage of Asian donors in the UK.  In this, the second of three programmes, Sabet talks to Faruk Choudhury. He is no relation, but he was Lord Mayor of Bristol in 2013 and he set out to increase the number of blood and organ donations from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities in the city. This was happening at the same time that Sabet was coming to terms with his mum’s failing health and his decision to donate, so he followed the Lord Mayor’s project closely and sees it as part of his own donation story.

Sabet, a BBC journalist, says the experience changed his life for the better too. He’s now fitter and healthier than before and he’s forged a closer relationship with his parents.

But just what is success and failure, particularly in the creative industries? And who makes that judgement anyway? The fairy story we love to hear is that all you need to do is follow your dream, and success will be yours. But for many the dream does not materialise. They don’t get that lucky break.  For others it’s just a long hard slog, and then there are those who reframe their ambitions as they go through life.

<item><title>Introverts &amp; Extroverts: Russell Kane &amp; Angela Barnes</title><description>What are you: an introvert or an extrovert? Russell Kane is a comedian, so he has always assumed he's a textbook loud-mouthed extrovert. But now he's not so sure.

Across this series of interviews, Russell explores exactly what we mean by the terms "introvert" and "extrovert". He questions whether it is useful to define people in this way and whether we have a cultural bias towards one personality type over the other.

In this third and final interview, Russell talks to fellow comedian Angela Barnes about playing the extrovert for work. Is there a disconnect between her on-stage and off-stage versions of self? And if so, are both authentic?

<item><title>Personality: Katya Adler talks to James Cracknell</title><description>For more than twenty years, from war zones to the seats of political power, Katya Adler has interviewed, observed, told people's stories. And she's always been fascinated by what makes people tick - their personality. Can we change or fake it?
In the first of three programmes, Katya meets Olympic athlete and Vice President of Headway, James Cracknell, who suffered an injury to the brain a decade ago which caused some of his personality traits to change. Katya and James discuss the impact of the injury on James's personality, the extent to which personality is observed by people around us and how our personalities can evolve.

<item><title>Lady Hale and Elsie Owusu on architecture &amp; justice</title><description>Architect Elsie Owusu discusses the refurbishment of the Supreme Court building with Lady Hale.

The creation of the Supreme Court in 2009 was a defining moment in UK legal history.  And in architectural history, too.  It was decided to refurbish the century-old Middlesex Guildhall which stands in London's Parliament Square.  At the time it housed seven Crown Courts and was, according to Lady Hale, 'cluttered and gloomy'.  Lady Hale, who has recently retired as the first female President of the Supreme Court, was involved in the renovation process, and worked alongside Elsie Owusu who was one of the architects.  Just over 10 years on, they get together to discuss what they wanted to achieve: a building of 'light and transparency' which would mirror the aims of the Supreme Court itself.

<item><title>Gerald Scarfe - bring back the news!</title><description>When photographer Paul Conroy was injured during a Syrian rocket attack in 2012, his first thought was probably not how this might change reporting of the war. Two other journalists died in the same attack - Remi Ochlik and Marie Colvin. Paul survived, wrote a book which became the basis for a famous documentary, and then worked as consultant on a major film, A Private War. Does his story represent a more powerful way of understanding the war? 

Five decades ago Gerald Scarfe went to Asia for The Daily Mail to cover the Vietnam war. He drew it, and here he shares his experiences with Paul as they discuss whether there are different ways to bring back the news. Future programmes in this series to include artist Arabella Dorman.

<item><title>City or Country? Alys Fowler meets Gregory Leadbetter</title><description>Acclaimed gardening writer, Alys Fowler, tries to work out where she wants to live, in the city or the countryside, with the help of poet, Gregory Leadbetter.
Alys grew up in deepest rural England but for years has found happiness in the city of Birmingham, her small garden and local allotment.  But she's starting to feel the pull of the countryside again, and the access to the natural world it offers.  However, Gregory - through the lens of poetry - discusses how paying close attention to nature wherever you are can have a profound effect.

<item><title>Growing Up with a Gay Dad</title><description>David Gregory-Kumar is a BBC journalist, and a gay dad. For this edition of One to One, he speaks to Sophie Mei Lan about her experience of growing up with a gay dad and step-dad.

Sophie Mei Lan is a journalist, blogger and vlogger in her early 30s. She grew up, from the age of 3, partly with her gay dad and step-dad.  She talks to David about the severe bullying she faced in high school, and how she learned to cope.  But she also recalls the lighter, if rather excruciating, moment when she was mistaken for her dad's child-bride.  Now that Sophie herself is a mum she sees a world that is more tolerant, and David agrees, but shares his feelings about living in Birmingham, a city where there have been protests against the teaching of LGBT equality in primary schools.

<item><title>The last space shuttle</title><description>In 2011, tech journalist Jack Dearlove was at university and won a competition to go to the Kennedy Space Center to "live tweet" the last American Space Shuttle. As a self-confessed space nerd, it was one of the most exciting - and emotional - days of his life. But what was it like for the astronauts on board? Here he talks to Doug Hurley, one of the four on board. Now in his fifties, Doug is still planning one last mission into space, with Elon Musk's new generation of space craft. If successful, it will allow American astronauts once again to go into space from American soil.

Lynne Truss has been a writer for over 25 years and without making it a conscious ambition she has travelled to a huge number of destinations. But if you ask her if she likes travelling, she will say "Absolutely not, I hate it. I find its utterly stressful." This has made her curious as to why we travel.  In an age when we have access to the world at the click of a button on the internet or the TV, why do we still want to physically go somewhere else?  What do we hope to get out of the experience?  Is the hassle of delayed flights, airless rooms, endless queues, the heat, the mosquitoes and the tummy upsets all really worth it? In this, the first of three programmes about the travel experience first broadcast in November, Lynne meets global traveller and writer Geoff Dyer.

<item><title>Coming Back From the Brink</title><description>Community Radio Awards 2016 Female Presenter of the Year, Primrose Granville talks to the Jamaican chef Henroy Brown about his near death experience as a young man in his twenties, when he was diagnosed first with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and then with the near fatal Steven Johnson syndrome. 

She herself came through a very traumatic point in her own life. In 2003 she was an Early Years/Special Needs practitioner with dreams of becoming a Head Teacher, married with a young son. A freak incident ended all that. Within 18 months she was unemployed, unemployable, separated and with no financial security. She was also mourning the loss of her father.

"For years I did nothing &amp; felt like nothing until someone introduced me to community radio." she says "Being out of work was the worst thing that ever happened to me, even more than the loss of my marriage, my father &amp; my financial freedom. I knew I had ambition but others didn't seem to. However, I never gave up, as losing my ambition was one loss too many." 

Primrose asks Henroy what gave him the strength to carry on when he was at his lowest point, and how he has managed to rebuild his life.

We hear a lot about teenage mothers, but very little about or from the teenage Dads who play an active part in their children's lives. What is it like for young men to find themselves responsible for a child at such a young age? How do they cope? In this series of frank discussions between young Dads, Michael Jenkins who became a father aged 18 talks to other young men who have gone through similar experiences. This week he talks to comedian Gary Meikle from Glasgow about his love for his daughter Ainsley who he brought up pretty much by himself.

Should Sian make the decision to have a baby or not to? And she wonders will she regret somewhere down the line not having them. She and Grace talk about how other people can make you feel when you haven't got children. 

As the successful writer of programmes like ' Man Down', 'The Now Show' and 'Dilemma', Sian Harries explores how a fear for her career might be affecting her decision to have children. Women certainly have more choice now about whether to become a mother, but does society really accept and respect that choice or is it generally assumed that all women want a baby and that she - and any women who feel ambivalent - will at some point change their minds?

Sian Harries has written comedy for The Now Show, Greg Davies' 'Man Down' and she's worked closely with her husband, the comedian Rhod Gilbert.

She asks Isy, who has chosen to have children, if she always knew she wanted too and whether it just felt "right"?

With them he explores how they perceive the people and the politics, now that they don't live there, and how their childhood affected their own world view. 

Peter first met Fiona Murphy when the two of them had recently arrived in Brixton from North Belfast in the 1980s. In the thirty years since they last saw each other Fiona has gone on to be a top human rights lawyer, with a specialism in police accountability. Peter talks to her about how the injustice she saw growing up during the troubles has influenced her own path, and how she sees Northern Ireland now.

Isabel Hardman, Assistant Editor of The Spectator, discusses with Dr Alan Kellas, a psychiatrist who advises the Royal College of Psychiatry on the subject. Isabel struggled with depression, and found that developing an interest in plants and working outside has helped her to recover. 

Meeting Alan in the woods, they talk of exercising outdoors, of watching the seasons turn, and of having regular places to visit that take us outside ourselves, allowing us to move beyond our own preoccupations. Alan reveals the ways in which he himself learned to resolve difficult things in a particular woodland setting.

However, for Trevor and his three sisters who were raised by his parents in the UK, this was something that didn't really have an impact on his family life until much later when Trevor finally met his half siblings.

It's something that has fascinated Trevor all his life, and now in this series of One to One, he meets people to uncover what it's like to have, or to find out you have, half siblings.

In this programme, Trevor meets Adrienne who has eight half siblings but no full brothers and sisters. She tells Trevor that that there is no jealousy and rivalry and that they really are one big happy family. Really?

He's sure that there is a link between the way comedians and sporting types deal with performance anxiety, crowd hostility, risk taking and more. Dr. Didymus, who works with sports stars at the highest level, casts light upon this theory.

<item><title>Lucy Mangan on Responsibility</title><description>Lucy Mangan avoids responsibility wherever possible. She's got cats instead of dogs because she can't face a needy pet; she only has one child 'and that's more than enough.' But she's always been fascinated by those who run towards responsibility rather than away from it. Today she talks to Reverend Claire Herbert about a life dedicated to helping others. One of the first women priests to be ordained, Claire was working as a rector at St Anne's church in Soho when the Admiral Duncan bomb exploded. But she admits that being there for others has not been an easy road - in her 30s she took some time out from full-time church work to become a social worker and learn to be young 'perhaps for the first time'; she has realized that she needs to learn to play, and now gives herself permission sometimes to be 'naughty and horrible.'.</description><itunes:subtitle>Lucy Mangan avoids responsibility.

<item><title>Nikesh Shukla talks to Kieran Farrell</title><description>Nikesh Shukla continues his series of interviews on boxing. The level of violence and serious injury has always called the sport into question. Just last year it saw the tragic death of Mike Towell after a fatal head injury and Nick Blackwell retired after a bleed on the brain. These stories are familiar to Kieran Farrell, who discovered a love of boxing aged just 7, and who had 26 fights in a row unbeaten - 14 as a professional. But then he collapsed from a bleed on the brain after a fight against Anthony Crolla. Despite 30% brain damage he was desperate to fight again, but was forced to retire aged 22. Four years on he runs a gym and acts as coach and promoter. He tells Nikesh what attracts a child to the sport, what that night took from him and why he's still happy to encourage children and adults to put on the gloves.

<item><title>Peter Bazalgette on Empathy</title><description>Television executive Peter Bazalgette talks to Jane Davis, founder of The Reader Organisation, about the power of shared reading in developing empathy, and how books can transform lives. Jane and her volunteers run small groups in which people meet to read books and poems aloud and talk about them. They meet in care homes, libraries, hostels, mental health centres, schools and prisons. 
Reading helped Jane to make sense of her own life and she wants to share that. She says: "You’ve already got your feelings, sometimes you just haven’t got any language for them. Something happens to you in shared reading, a sudden moment - a feeling of recognition, of seeing written down something you’ve had as nameless (and therefore in a sense unknown), taking some form in the visible world, so you can begin to know it. And there’s something so important about that – it’s a form of consciousness".

Professor Sir Denis Pereira Gray was a GP for 38 years and is now Patron of the National Association for Patient Participation. He believes that humanity and empathy in medicine contributes to a better outcome for all concerned, and research evidence is piling up in support of that view. Empathy in clinical practice can be fostered through training, narrative medicine and continuity of care.

The journalist Datshiane Navanayagam had a challenging childhood punctuated by periods of homelessness but she was always expected to achieve academically. She won a bursary to a private school which led her onto Cambridge University. As a result she's fascinated by the transformative role education can have. For One to One she's speaking to three people who have been on unexpected educational journeys.

Today she meets Helen Pike. Born in Preston and educated entirely in the state sector, Helen Pike has almost exclusively worked in private schools and has just been appointed as the first female head teacher in the 500 year history of the independent Magdalen College School. At one stage she was the head teacher of the school that Datshiane attended (although not while Datshiane was there). They speak about background, confidence and breaking boundaries.

<item><title>Tim Samuels talks to Helen</title><description>Tim Samuels goes in search of alternative relationships and meets women who have ditched traditional monogamy in favour of part-time, polygamous and pragmatic love. 

Tim recently wrote about the challenges of being a 21st century man, including how monogamy can be a struggle. He's not the first man to feel it could run counter to men's biological make-up. And these days, in heterosexual couple break ups, female infidelity is just as likely to be cited as a cause for divorce as the male half of the partnership straying. 

Tim says we are now living in a world where religion has lost its grip, women are freer than ever before to express their sexuality without male diktats, and we are continually evolving and adapting to changing times. He's long been interested in alternatives to monogamy, and now he wants to hear about some actual examples. 

In the first of his three programmes for One to One, Tim meets Helen who has ripped up the relationship rules to find a model that works for her. She is a mother of two, but partner of none.

<item><title>David Greig and Angela Mudge</title><description>What does it take to be a successful runner of extreme distance and why do people do it? 

David Greig is the Artistic Director of the Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh and an internationally successful playwright. He's also an ultra-marathon runner who has twice completed the punishing 96 mile West Highland Way as well as many other long-distance races. He took up running fifteen years ago when he stopped smoking and running has since become an endorphin-fuelled obsession.

For One to One, David is speaking to two fellow runners. Today he meets former world hill running champion, Angela Mudge. Born with birth defects that affected her feet, Angela spent the first two and half years of life almost continually with her lower legs and feet in plaster. Despite this, she went onto be a hugely successful long-distance runner. Her most memorable race was when she became the first woman to break three hours when she won the Sierre-Zinal - 'the race of the 4000m peaks'.

But why do they do it?

He took up running fifteen years ago when he stopped smoking and running has since become an endorphin-fuelled obsession.

For One to One, David speaks to two fellow runners. Today, he meets Ben Smith who - at the time of their conversation - was attempting to set a world record by running 401 marathons on 401 consecutive days. Following a difficult childhood and a challenging time during his 20s, Ben discovered running and it became a form of confidence building and healing. Out of this new sense of confidence, Ben decided to set himself an outlandish challenge, and the 401 was the result.

<item><title>Jan Ravens talks to Germaine Greer</title><description>Jan Ravens has created impressions of some of our most iconic women but all she has to work with is the public persona, how someone in the public eye presents themselves for our view. In her series of One to One she talks to some of her subjects about their image as seen by others and how it differs from how they see themselves. Is image something they have consciously created or has it sprung naturally from their personality and from the way they look? Jan wants to know if their self perception is changed through their portrayal by impressionists and cartoonists.
Is image a useful tool, or does it become a millstone around your neck ?
Academic and author, Germaine Greer, has been in the public eye for over forty years, she talks to Jan about the way her image has changed over the decades.

He wants to overcome his fears and find out whether a 'good death' is ever possible and how those facing up to it, cope. He visits the journalist and writer Jenny Diski who was told last summer that she had inoperable lung cancer and, at best, another three years to live. She now writes about the experience and her treatment, with her usual wit and candour, and her tweets have a devoted following. But as she says, 'I tell jokes but that doesn't mean that I'm not terrified at the prospect of my own non-existence.' They discuss this fear, what it is they are afraid of and whether faith might make a difference.

In his two editions of One to One, he wants to try to overcome his fear by talking to those who have first-hand understanding of dying.

With almost forty years of clinical experience and witnessing over twelve thousand deaths, she believes that a 'good death' is possible even when you are seriously ill. She explains the process of dying to David. This, she believes, if accepted by the patient, removes much of the anxiety and fear surrounding the end of life.

In this first programme he meets Ed Stafford. Ed was the first person to walk the entire length of the Amazon River - 6000 miles over two and a half years. Ed acknowledges that explorers have a 'chink in their armour, an insecurity, a fear of something in life... Doing something tangible, something remarkable, enables you to prove yourself'.

<item><title>Adrian Chiles speaks to Larissa Pelham</title><description>Adrian Chiles talks to Larissa Pelham, Head of Emergency Food Security and Livelihoods for Oxfam, about how charities seek to eradicate malnourishment in the Third World, by working with local food producers.

It's well known that TV and radio presenter Adrian Chiles loves football. What's less well known is his real passion: food, both eating and cooking it. Adrian believes in the power of food to change lives, to improve society and to bring people together. 

At this year's Bristol Food Connections festival, he recorded two editions of One to One in front of an audience with guests who have extraordinary life changing food stories to tell. 

Larissa Pelham has spent most of her career trying to ensure that all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food, that's the definition of food security, but she explains the difficulties of doing this in areas of political unrest or natural disaster. 

She also discusses with Adrian the effect her work has had on her own attitude to food and eating.

John is known for having two consuming passions music, and politics - and luckily he's developed a career that revolves around both. But around five years ago, he acquired a third area of expertise and curiosity: autism.

His son James was born in 2006 and, when he was 3, it was discovered he was autistic. For John and his partner, the next two or three years passed in a blur of educational therapy, tussles with officialdom, James's successful entry to a mainstream school, and reading: lots and lots of it.

In his first edition of One to One, John talked to Simon Baron-Cohen, Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at Cambridge University and Director of the University's Autism Research Centre.

Today he talks to Penny about how the condition has affected her life and how she has learnt to live with it, holding down an intellectually challenging job and married life.

They discuss how schools and employers can help those on the autistic spectrum make the most of the gifts and talents they have and understand better the more challenging aspects of the condition.

In this first programme, John talks to Simon Baron-Cohen, a professor at Cambridge University in psychology and psychiatry, and also the director of the University's Autism Research Centre. Over more than thirty years, his work has made a huge contribution to an increasingly nuanced, sophisticated understanding of autism, and helped a lot of people, including John.

<item><title>Charlotte Smith meets Sarah O'Donoghue</title><description>Charlotte Smith looks at the support offered by self help groups to those suffering from emotional trauma.

When Sarah O'Donoghue's eighteen year old son died while out celebrating his A level results, she felt she needed to turn to the professionals for help; doctors, bereavement counsellors, therapists.

It was only after many months that she finally turned to The Compassionate Friends; one of the several charities that offers support and help to bereaved families after the death of a child. Here she found solace by talking to and being with others who had been through the same experience themselves.

Sarah now runs a group for bereaved families in her area.

Charlotte and Sarah discuss the positives and negatives of being part of such a group; the support that is given to people who so badly need it, whether there is a danger members could become too dependent, and at what point people might make the sometimes painful decision to leave a group.

<item><title>Adrian Goldberg on Mixed Marriage</title><description>In two (repeated) interviews for One to One, broadcaster Adrian Goldberg - who is married to a British Asian woman - explores the topic of mixed marriage.

The dry facts, from the Office of National Statistics, state that "Nearly 1 in 10 people living in as a couple were in an inter-ethnic relationship in 2011".*

Now Adrian brings this statistic to life as he meets two people who married outside their own faith or cultural background, across different decades.

In this first programme he meets Tara Bariana. Tara arrived in England from India in the 1960s and was, in his words, an illiterate 13 year old who couldn't speak English. He was expected to marry a Punjabi girl, but went against his family's wishes when he met and fell in love with Beryl, the daughter of a Baptist minister. Adrian hears Tara's story, and finds out what happened next.

*figures from the 2011 census.

<item><title>Victoria Derbyshire meets Alastair Campbell</title><description>The broadcaster Victoria Derbyshire has kept a diary since she was a child. She talks to Alastair Campbell about the habit of diary writing, and why he keeps a diary. She finds out why he started writing them, and whether, now he is so well known for them, the decision to publish affected the people close to him. 

Alastair Campbell talks frankly about the two occasions when his diary was read by others in circumstances beyond his control - one when he had a nervous breakdown and a police psychiatrist used his diary entries to help him see the part drink played in his problems; and the other when Lord Hutton asked to see his diaries as part of the inquiry into the death of David Kelly.

<item><title>Tim Dowling talks to Saira Khan</title><description>Tim Dowling fell into journalism by mistake; he is not an ambitious man, never was, never will be, but he's fascinated by what it means to be desperately driven to succeed.

He talks to those who have ambition searing through their veins.
Today he meets Saira Khan, business woman and runner-up in the tv show The Apprentice, who claims to have been ambitious since she was a small child. Growing up in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, the oldest of four children of Pakistani immigrants, she set her heart on doing better than her parents, having financial security and learning the confidence to do whatever she wanted. Starting out as a town planner, she found her natural place in the sales team of a biscuit manufacturer. Since her appearance on 'The Apprentice', she went on to run her own business, and is now also a TV presenter and motivational speaker.

Saira's also a mother. She talks candidly about wishing not to be a pushy parent and about her need to curb her ambitious streak where her children are concerned.

Saira and Tim discuss the merits and drawbacks of ambition: does it lead to happiness and fulfilment or a never-ending nagging discontent and anxiety?

The BBC's Kabul correspondent, David Loyn, talks to his cousin, political analyst Hekmat Karzai.

What chance does Afghanistan have of moving towards a stable democracy?

She regards herself as a feminist, she demands equality in the workplace and in all aspects of her secular life. But she has a secret: as an orthodox Jew, when attending synagogue, she is happy to sit separately from the men, not to take part in the service and is finding it hard to embrace the concept of women rabbis.

In this second of two programmes for One to One, she discusses her prejudice with Rabbi Sylvia Rothschild who, when faced with the comment 'I don't really believe in a female Rabbi', retorts, 'Well I'm not Tinkerbell'.

Can Emma resolve the conflict between her public and her private life; the contradiction between her feminist self and her religious self?

Emma says; 'This is an uncomfortable position, I want to rid my brain of these views, which don't make sense to me in my daily life. I would like unpack this double standard and get rid of this illogical hypocrisy.'

This week she talks to a highly successful barrister, feminist and orthodox jew who explains how she relieves the tensions raised by her contradictory life.

Last month Nigel Farage said controversially that if women in the City were prepared to sacrifice family life they could do just as well as men.

But there are now a number of senior City women who do combine their careers with motherhood. Charlotte Crosswell is Chief Executive Officer of the trading derivatives platform of NASDAQ in London and a mother of one, so how does she make it work ?

In this series of interviews for 'One to One', Anita discovers what drives people towards certain careers. Was there an epiphany, something they discovered in their very core, or a series of events that motivated them?

This week's guest is Mathew Waddington, a partner in a Midlands and South-West based legal firm. He entered law relatively late having worked in the travel industry, after studying history. He was a trainee solicitor, unsure where to specialise, when his daughter, who was born with a rare chromosomal abnormality, died. It suddenly became clear to him that he should work in children's law. He became a Children's Panel solicitor representing abused children in care cases, as well as parents and grandparents in other Children Act cases.

In this series of interviews for 'One to One', Anita discovers what drives people to pursue certain careers. Was there an epiphany, something in their very core, or a series of events that motivated them?

This week's guest is world-renowned facial surgeon, Professor Iain Hutchison. In the very early part of his career he spent a year working in casualty. He treated many young men with facial injuries sustained in car accidents. He realised that - simply by stitching them up under local anaesthetic - he could make not just a medical, but an emotional difference to their lives. It was this that led him onto his career in facial surgery, and to the establishment of a charity that researches the prevention and treatment of facial diseases and injuries.

Next week Anita speaks to Mathew Waddington, a partner in a law firm who chose to specialise in children's law following the death of his daughter.

<item><title>Anita Anand talks to Juliet Lyon</title><description>Anita Anand knew she was meant to be a journalist from the moment she covered her first news story. An instinct she followed proved to be correct, and convinced her that she should pursue journalism.

In this series of interviews for 'One to One', Anita discovers what drives people to pursue certain careers. Was there an epiphany, something they discovered in their very core, or a series of events that motivated them?

Anita's first guest is Juliet Lyon. She's the director of the Prison Reform Trust, a charity 'working to create a just, humane and effective penal system.' In her early 20s she fostered children, and went on to work in a school at the adolescent-unit of a psychiatric hospital. One patient was due to enter a young offenders' institution, so she went to see what it was like. Shocked by what she found, she knew she wanted to try and improve conditions within prisons.

Anita also interviews world-renowned maxillo-facial surgeon, Professor Iain Hutchison and lawyer Mathew Waddington, who specialised in Children's Law following the death of his daughter.

<item><title>Carolyn Quinn speaks to Claire Derry</title><description>As a Radio 4 presenter, covering a range of stories everyday, Carolyn Quinn interviews people while the story is live but rarely gets the chance to find out what happened next.

For these editions of One to One, Carolyn wanted to find out what happens to individuals who've found themselves in the media spotlight and have had to live with intense, unsolicited scrutiny. How do they cope once the media caravan has moved on and they have to try to get on with their lives


This week, Carolyn speaks to Claire Derry, the mother of Samuel Woodhead, the British teenager who went missing in the Australian outback in February 2013.

Samuel Woodhead was working on a cattle station in rural Queensland - just a few days into his gap year in Australia - when he decided to go for a run. He failed to return and was reported missing. A land and air search eventually found him three days later: three stone lighter, severely dehydrated and apparently 'hours from death'.

In this interview Claire Derry describes what it was like to cope with what had happened to her son, at the same time as dealing with intense media interest which - at one stage - turned against her son, accusing him of deliberately getting lost. And has she been able to return to "life as normal" after the experience?

Some of those bullets hit the core of his body and damaged his spinal nerve - he can no longer use his legs and is in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. However, being able to return to work and continue with his profession has been one of the biggest factors in his own recovery.

This was for him a catastrophic life changing injury. But while he was in hospital he received an email from someone who too had been shot in the back and said- 'I've got some advice and tips on how to cope'.

This was for him a catastrophic life changing injury. But while he was in hospital he received an email from someone who too had been shot in the back and said- 'I've got some advice and tips on how to cope'. In this first of three programmes for the series 'One to One' Frank Gardner explores how one copes with a life changing injury and begins by talking to Dr Stuart Butchart who gave Frank hope.

<item><title>Owen Bennett Jones talks to Jake Wood</title><description>Owen Bennett-Jones has spent most of his BBC career reporting on armed conflict around the world. On March 2003 he was in Kuwait as the US forces began their invasion of Iraq. While talking to the American writer PJ O'Rourke, Owen said how frightened the soldiers heading into Iraq must be, but O'Rourke replied: "Well, they are off to do the most exciting thing ever known to man: going to war".

It was a striking remark. Was he glorifying war? Or just telling a truth? Since humans first started to communicate, they have been telling - and listening to - war stories. And, alongside the empathy and fellow feeling for victims, the accounts of bravery, suffering and cheating death are compelling and perhaps vicariously thrilling.


Jake Wood knows the real story of war. As a member of the Territorial Army, Jake completed 3 tours of Iraq and Afghanistan over a five-year period. In the second of two programmes for 'One To One' about the reality of war, Owen asks him about his final tour in Southern Afghanistan and about one day in particular: the 11 August 2007. 

Jake was at Forward Operating Base Inkerman - a camp with mud walls in the Sangin Valley - when the Taliban attacked.

<item><title>Clive Myrie talks to Mike Nowak</title><description>BBC News presenter, Clive Myrie, presents the last of three interviews on immigration as seen from an immigrant's point of view.

As the son of Jamaican immigrants who came to the UK in the 1960s, Clive has a personal interest in this topic. Clive lived abroad as a foreign correspondent for almost 15 years, returning once or twice a year to see his family. After 2004 he noticed how much the UK was changing: the EU had expanded, Polish people were settling here in large numbers and the transformation came as a shock.

In the first programme he spoke to Alp Mehmet, Vice-Chair of Migration Watch. Then he met Sylvia Emenike who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1950s and explored her experience of seeing other immigrant communities settling in the UK. In this, his third and final interview, he speaks to Mike Nowak, a Pole who lived for many years in Britain, but who has now returned home to Warsaw.

Mike came to England long before the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, so witnessed the increase in Polish immigration for himself. Suddenly he was able to speak in his mother-tongue all day, every day, and witnessed Polish shops and businesses starting up around him.

Recently he made the decision to return to Warsaw. Clive asks what changes Mike has seen back in Poland since he first left, and finds out where Polish opinion stands on further EU immigration.</description><itunes:subtitle>Clive Myrie speaks to Mike Nowak, a Polish immigrant, who has now returned to Warsaw.</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>BBC News presenter, Clive Myrie, presents the last of three interviews on immigration as seen from an immigrant's point of view.

<item><title>John McCarthy meets Afghan refugee Rafi</title><description>John McCarthy talks to those who by accident or design, feel they live outside mainstream British society. Today he talks to Rafi, who fled to this country from Afghanistan in 2011, after working as an interpreter for the allied forces. Rafi explains how he took on the role in the hope of improving relations in his country but in fact it left him isolated from his home community and the people he worked for. Threats from the Taliban caused him to flee his homeland and to seek asylum here. After eighteen months of isolation in this country, he has now gained refugee status and can look for work but he explains the loneliness he feels living on the outside and away from his home, his friends and family.

<item><title>05/02/2013</title><description>John McCarthy talks to a young woman who was made to feel an outsider within her own community, for becoming the victim of her husband's physical and psychological abuse.
John says of the series:
I hope to talk to people who are living on the 'outside' of mainstream UK society. On the street they would look like anyone else but in fact they are somehow apart. I have experienced being an 'outsider' myself; on my return from captivity in Lebanon, when I'd look like any other Londoner, but would feel utterly self-conscious and confused by the world around me. I've had similar feelings following the deaths of close family members. One experience was very rare, the other universal.
I want to explore the idea of being an outsider; having conversations with others who will have walked those same private/public paths either through choice or because of circumstances beyond their control.
What is it like being on the 'outside'? How do you cope with loneliness and feelings of being excluded? What are the attractions of removing yourself from society? What are the practicalities of such a life, the numbness of living in a fog for so long? How do you keep strong and maintain your hopes of coming in from the cold; of not giving in and renouncing your solitary way?

Having been brought up in a household that was always at action stations as part of his father's long campaign to become a Liberal MP, perseverance has always fascinated Martin. What instils it? What nurtures it? Can it become an obsession at the cost of everything else , including family?
In this first programme he talks to Lindis Percy, now approaching seventy, she's been a political campaigner for some forty years, for the last thirty of them on the issue of American airbases in the UK. Lindis has been arrested five hundred times and served fifteen prison terms but she continues to campaign undeterred. Under the banner of the Campaign for the Accountability of American Airbases she still demonstrated every Tuesday outside the base at Menwith Hill in North Yorkshire.
Martin joins her there to discover what still inspires her to lobby and litigate when so many of her fellow peace campaigners have fallen by the way side. As a mother of three and a lifelong worker in the National Health Service, how has she managed to juggle her campaigning with family and professional life?

<item><title>Olivia O'Leary with Vladimir Ashkenazy</title><description>In a new series of One to One, Olivia O'Leary speaks to people who've reached the peak of their careers about how growing older affects their approach to work.

In this first programme, Olivia speaks to one of her heroes - the great Russian-Icelandic pianist, Vladimir Ashkenazy. He left the Soviet union in the sixties, and has played a vast repertoire of the greatest piano music on stages all over the world. Ashkenazy is now conductor laureate with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London and Principal Conductor and Artistic Advisor to the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. 

At 75 he is still jetting around the world to engagements so we were lucky to catch up with him in a hotel at Heathrow as he was leaving after a brief visit to the UK.

In a candid discussion, Ashkenazy discussed the arthrosis (not arthritis as has been reported) in his hands which occasionally means his fingers cannot fit between the black keys; he talks about not wanting to become the kind of 'older' conductor, with failing physical capacity, that orchestras respond to purely out of respect.

He also talks more widely - about his decision to leave Russia in the 1960s; about the pianists he holds in great respect and about his decision to concentrate on conducting rather than live performance.

<item><title>Kate Silverton on how our fear of failure impacts on the choices we make.</title><description>In this One to One we explore how our experience at school can leave kids afraid to take risks as they fear failure. Kate Silverton desperately wanted to be a journalist from the age of 12. In her teens she travelled extensively - hitch-hiking across Israel and visiting the Palestinian territories in an attempt to better understand the conflict there, she stayed in a Bedouin in the desert and at nineteen went to Zimbabwe for four months armed with just a dictaphone to capture the stories of the people she met along the way. Despite her natural curiosity about the world and her desire to report stories of people living in conflict she didn't follow her heart because she feared she might fail. As the first in her family to go to university much depended on her and her career choice and she opted to enter the City as a Corporate Financier - a demanding job but one that diverted from her doing the one thing she wanted to do - because she feared she might not be good enough. It took the death of her best friend to convince her to change her mind. In this second and final series on 'failure' businesswoman Kate Hardcastle  examines how her experience at school impacted on her life choices.

<item><title>02/10/2012</title><description>Sarfraz Manzoor meets author, Elizabeth Wurtzel, to discuss her book 'Prozac Nation'.

In 'One to One' the journalist and broadcaster, Sarfraz Manzoor, has been exploring the risks and rewards of taking a personal story and making it public. This is something he's done in his book 'Greetings from Bury Park' and within his journalism where he's written - amongst other topics - about his mixed-marriage and the experience of being a new father. He's intrigued by both the process and the ramifications of revealing private thoughts and experiences: How do people react to you? Do they see it as a betrayal? Do you risk hurting friends and family? Is it worth the risk if you achieve something that truly resonates with your audience? 

In this, the last of his three interviews, Sarfraz Manzoor speaks to the author of 'Prozac Nation', Elizabeth Wurtzel. Published in the mid-1990s, it was considered the first in the 'misery memoir' genre and was a huge success. But how does Wurtzel feel about what she wrote now, almost 20 years on?

Paddy lost his father when he was 11, and in last week's programme he met Sir Al Aynsley-Green whose career was shaped by the early loss of his own father.

This week's programme takes a slightly different tack as Paddy meets Lisa Cherry, whose childhood was spent in the Care System.

Born in a home for unmarried mothers, her childhood was spent moving from foster home to care home and a spell of homelessness. Eventually Lisa managed to get control of her spiralling life - giving up drinking and getting an education was the making of her.

When Paddy was 11 his father died, and in this week's programme -- in order to explore what impact this can have -- he meets Professor Sir Al Aynsley-Green who, at the age of 10, lost his own father. Almost immediately he decided that, when he grew up, he would become a doctor so that other children "didn't have to lose their mummies and daddies". 

This passion for helping children has continued throughout his career: Sir Al was the first Children's Commissioner for England (2005-2010), having also been involved in the political arena of Children's Services since 2000. He was appointed Chair of the NHS Taskforce for Children and then the first National Clinical Director for Children in government. He believes strongly that the topic of childhood bereavement should be spoken about more openly.

<item><title>Razia Iqbal talks to Hanif Qadir</title><description>Razia Iqbal takes the One to One chair for the next three weeks to try to discover what it means to be a Muslim in Europe in the 21st century. She talks to three people, in three countries, about their identity as Muslims where they live against a context of prejudice and misunderstandings about their faith. 
This week she talks to Hanif Qadir who decided to reject fighting in Afghanistan on the side of the Taliban and chose to help young people in the UK who were in danger of becoming radicalised. In Walthamstow, East London, he set up the Active Change Foundation to encourage young people to a positive future. He explains to Razia about what motivated him to become involved with the Taliban and why he ultimately chose to turn his back on them. 
Razia says, 'There are fifteen million Muslims in Europe. The continent looks completely different now compared to how it looked two decades ago. I want to talk to people for whom navigating that change is almost a daily challenge'

Here she talks to Charles Hanson who was convicted for the murder of his third wife, Julie, seventeen years ago.
Now in his sixties, Charles has spent over half his life in prison for a string of violence related crimes; violence being the only way he knew, to resolve conflict. When Julie ran off with his son from his first marriage,Charles decided the only course of action left open to him, was to resort to murder. He explains to Mary Ann why he came to this conclusion, why even the threat of the death penalty would not have deterred him, how it took him eight years to feel remorse and how the event still haunts him.

And it's precisely because I'll never know at first hand what it's like (I hope) that I'm so curious to get inside the mind of a killer. Whether it's someone who is sanctioned to kill, like a soldier; someone who kills accidentally, like a dangerous driver; or someone who does it on purpose, like a murderer, I want to know the answers to all sorts of fascinating questions. What goes through their mind at the time? How did it happen? How do they feel afterwards? And are they haunted by the event for the rest of their life?"
In this first programme she talks to Chantelle Taylor, an army medic who shot a Taliban fighter when caught in an ambush in Afghanistan.

Living locally, Fi's been fascinated by the way this area of Hackney has rapidly become the third most important technical start up centre in the world.- after Silicon Valley and New York. As a magnet to some of the most enterprising and innovative internet companies, Old Street Roundabout has been renamed Silicon Roundabout.

This generation of entrepreneurs are bringing back some old British business values: they're inventive, risk taking and barrier breaking. In the first programme she meets a veteran of Silicon Valley, Dan Crow . Now the chief technology officer at Songkick, he's had the expected triumphs and disasters in internet start-ups but feels this quiet revolution, that's happening now in Hackney, may have a real impact in changing the economic fortunes of Britain. 

He explains to Fi why this should make us cheerful: a survey from the Boston Consulting Group recently put the UK as the leader of the G20 nations in our internet economy - so we are top at something after all .

Programme 2: From Poland to the Arab Spring

Samira meets Konstanty Gebert one of Poland's best-known and most respected journalists. During Poland's Communist dictatorship, he operated underground; laboriously hand-printing documents which were secretly distributed; avoiding the police who would constantly follow his movements. In One to One he recalls those years, and describes what it was like when he and his colleagues were eventually able to join a free press. He makes comparisons with journalists in Arab spring countries, and discusses what they could possibly glean from his experiences.

Samira has spent 20 years reporting breaking news at home and abroad from Britain to Los Angeles to Berlin. Born to Hindu and Muslim parents and educated at a Catholic school, Samira married into a Northern Irish family. As a result, she's aware of the way news coverage can make sweeping assumptions about stories and tries to seek out the missing angles behind the headlines. 

With that in mind, her first guest, Lucy Mathen, tells a tale of charitable endeavour, with a surprising twist.

Lucy Mathen joined John Craven's Newsround in 1976, becoming the BBC's first female British Asian to present a major TV programme. Several years later, after interviewing a local doctor in Afghanistan, she decided she could achieve a great deal more in a warzone by working as a doctor, not as a journalist. So she retrained as an ophthalmologist, and in 2000 launched the charity Second Sight which runs eye hospitals in northern India helping to cure cataracts for thousands of people.

But the story we're telling in One to One is about football....

<item><title>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown with Megan</title><description>For personal reasons, the journalist and broadcaster Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, has chosen to explore the impact of divorce on families for 'One to One'.

Yasmin divorced over twenty years ago, and - although happily re-married - often contemplates the fall-out of divorce, and the resulting emotional ripples which inevitably reach further than the separating couple. In these programmes she's hearing the stories of a grandparent, a parent and a young person who have all lived through a family break-up

So far Yasmin has spoken to a grandmother who hasn't seen her granddaughter for four years, and to the author, Louis de Bernieres, who is patron of Families Need Fathers.

This week she speaks to 18 year old Megan, who describes the experience of living through her parents' divorce.

The charity Young Minds put us in touch with Megan. Their website is www.youngminds.org.uk and Megan is part of the Young Minds VIK (Very Important Kids) project.

Young Minds has a Parents' Helpline which is for any adult who is concerned about the mental health or wellbeing of any child or young adult. It's free to call and the number is 0808 802 5544 (Monday to Friday 9.30am-4pm)

Twenty five year ago Jeremy Middleton set out to make money. He wasn't sure how he was going to do it but he wanted the freedom and autonomy he felt it would bring. When Homeserve, the company he'd co-founded, was floated on the stock market, he achieved his goal and made the Rich list. So did it bring him the freedom he wanted? Lucy talks to him about the trappings of wealth and what they mean, the problems of lending money to friends and if he still gets a buzz from business.

For Ann (she wishes to remain anonymous) the day her company was floated on the stock market and became a multi millionaire, she was paralysed by fear. 
'I had always believed that rich people were not nice people. I was terrified my money would taint and destroy my relationships with friends and loved ones'.
A decade on, she has come to terms with her position, becoming a member of The Network for Social Change, ' for people who want to do more than sign a cheque' and having worked out how she wants to spend her money and who she wants to give it to.
She talks honestly to Lucy about how she maintains boundaries on her spending and whether she now feels it's possible to be rich and nice.

He talks to Evan about why he started lying and how it overtook his life, bringing material comfort and excitement but also social isolation.

<item><title>Lyse Doucet with Rangina Hamidi</title><description>Lyse Doucet is in Kabul to talk to Rangina Hamidi who runs a successful company which gives women economic independence. However she's now 'given up' on Afghanistan following the murder of her father who - at the time of his death - was the Mayor of Kandahar. 

In 1981, at the age of three, Rangina Hamidi's family escaped their native Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation. They spent seven years in Pakistan before moving to the United States and settling in Virginia.

But in 2003 (following the fall of the Taliban) Rangina returned to Afghanistan and set up Kandahar Treasure; a private company run by women, it makes and sells traditionally embroidered fabric. 

However, Rangina is now packing up and leaving, returning to the United States. The reason is the recent murder of her father, Ghulam Haider Hamidi, who was killed in a suicide bomb attack in July. His death has left her feeling 'negative' and 'pessimistic' , and although her decision to leave makes her feel as if she has failed, she says she needs the space to heal. 

One day she may return, and hopes it will be to a more peaceful country. 

Join Lyse Doucet as she speaks to Rangina Hamidi for this week's One to One.

<item><title>Lyse Doucet with Nader Nadery</title><description>For this week's edition of 'One to One' Lyse Doucet has travelled to Kabul to speak to Nader Nadery, a human rights campaigner who, despite living under direct threat from the Taliban, continues to work for the future of his country. 

He's in his thirties, which means that in his lifetime his country has never been at peace. When he was eight his primary school was destroyed by the Mujahideen and, in his twenties, he was arrested and tortured by the Taliban. Highly educated and able to live abroad should he want to, he's chosen to remain in Kabul and now works for a human rights organisation. His inspiration is Ghandi - his telephone screensaver bears his image - yet he must travel in an armoured car for his own protection.

<item><title>Lyse Doucet with Saad Mohseni</title><description>Lyse Doucet presents the second in Radio 4's new interview series where respected broadcasters follow their passions by speaking to the people whose stories interest them most. 

Lyse has a long-standing connection to the country and people of Afghanistan, having reported from there for over 20 years. This month marks the 10th anniversary of the American led invasion, a good time to reflect on recent history and consider the future. This week she's talking to a media mogul who's changed the face of popular culture in a country where, until recently, TV was banned:

Saad Mohseni has become known as Afghanistan's answer to Rupert Murdoch. Until recently he would have accepted that as a huge compliment, perhaps no longer. But, either way, Mohseni is a big player. Running his media empire out of offices in Dubai and Kabul, he's revolutionised TV and Radio broadcasting in Afghanistan by 
introducing local versions of international hits like Afghan Star (a singing competition in the X-Factor mould) and controversial radio programmes where male and female broadcasters are in studio together.

His father was an Afghan diplomat who moved his family around the world - London, Tokyo, Kabul, with a long period in Australia. where, eventually, Saad became an investment banker.

But shortly after the fall of the Taliban, Saad Mohseni returned to Afghanistan and, long fascinated with the media, established a hugely successful media empire. 

Join Lyse as she speaks to Saad Mohseni for One to One.

<item><title>Lyse Doucet with Masood Khalili</title><description>One to One is a new series of interviews on Radio 4 in which well respected broadcasters follow their personal passions by talking to the people whose stories interest them most. 

The first set of interviews will be presented by Lyse Doucet. 

Lyse Doucet has a long-standing connection to the country and people of Afghanistan; she's reported from there for over 20 years. 

Over the next four weeks Lyse will be in conversation with Afghans - young and old, living at home and abroad - to hear their remarkable stories. This month marks the 10th anniversary of the American-led invasion of Afghanistan, a good time to reflect on recent history and consider the future.

Masood Khalili is Afghanistan's Ambassador to Spain, but he's also a poet who says his life is "10% about politics and 90% about culture". 

On the 9th of September 2001, he was the only survivor of an Al Qaeda suicide bomb attack which killed his friend and legendary military leader, Ahmad Shah Masood. An attack which is regarded as a pre-cursor to 9/11.

Khalili's injuries were so severe that he was lucky to live and can no longer endure the dry, dusty conditions of his homeland. Lyse Doucet went to see him in Madrid where he described the bomb blast and the impact it has had on him. 

He also talked about his occasional visits to, and memories of, his beloved garden near Kabul. That garden is a metaphor for the way he regards his country - 

"I see a flower there and it's blossoming and I say my country will be ok. my country will be like that flower".
